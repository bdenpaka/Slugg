Work in progress

I created this Bash script for my Cybersecurity Bootcamp Project 4.

The purpose of the script is to take a user-defined variable and parse Linux system configuration files and provide the user with a clean and legible output.
  * It parses from /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/sudoers groups and checks for home directories
